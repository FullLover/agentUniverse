# Docker container deployment

AgentUniverse provides standard work environment images for containerized deployment of AgentUniverse projects. This document will explain how to deploy your own project based on the such images.

## Preparations
1.  Build your own project according to the standard directory structure of AgentUniverse, referring to [Application_Engineering_Structure_Explanation](1_4_Application_Engineering_Structure_Explanation.md)。For ease of explanation, this document assumes the project name and project directory are `sample_standard_app`.
2.   Get the required version of the AgentUniverse image.
```shell
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/agent_universe/agent_universe:0.0.5_centos8_beta
```


## Method 1: Mount the host path
You can mount your project to a path inside the container by mounting the host directory, with the reference command as follows:
```shell
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v ./sample_standard_app/:/usr/local/etc/workspace/project registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/agent_universe/agent_universe:0.0.5_centos8_beta
```
The`-p 8888:8888`represents the port mapping for the Web Server. The first 8888 indicates that the web server inside the container is started on port 8888, and the latter indicates that it is mapped to port 8888 on the host machine. Adjust it according to the actual startup conditions of the application as needed.  
`-v {local_dir}:/usr/local/etc/workspace/project`indicates that the `local_dir` directory on the host is mounted to the `/usr/local/etc/workspace/project`within the container. The directory path inside the container is a fixed value and cannot be modified.

### Precautions:：
If you need multiple containers to mount the same directory, it's advised to pay attention to the following points when using this method:：
1. Specify a SQLite database file address outside the mounted path `/usr/local/etc/workspace/project`in the config.toml, such as inside `/usr/local/etc` in the container, for example,
    ```toml
    system_db_uri = 'sqlite:////usr/local/etc/agent_universe.db'
    ```
    This can reduce the problems with SQLite concurrency (as SQLite does not handle concurrency very well). Alternatively, you can directly use MySQL, which will offer better concurrency performance.
2. Specify a directory outside the mounted path in the log_config.toml, like
    ```toml
    log_path = "/usr/local/etc/au_log"
    ```
    To prevent all containers from logging in the same file, which makes it difficult to read.

## Method 2: Pull the project from Github
The image already has the git command installed. You can modify the image's entrypoint to git clone your project and then copy the entire project to a specified path. For example:
```shell
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --entrypoint=/bin/bash registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/agent_universe/agent_universe:0.0.5_centos8_beta -c "git clone {repo_addr}; mv {project_dir} /usr/local/etc/workspace/project; /bin/bash --login /usr/local/etc/workspace/shell/start.sh"
````
Where `repo_addr` is the address of your git project，and `project_dir` is the project directory, for example，if `sample_standard_app` is in the `project`directory within your git project, then`project_dir` would be `project/sample_standard_app`。
## Result Verification
Taking the example of port 8888, you can verify whether the service has started correctly using the curl command:
```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/echo
```
Try to access the web service, and if it returns the word "Welcome" it means the service has started successfully.
