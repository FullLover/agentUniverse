# Domain Component Principles
agentUniverse includes several domain components, which combine to form the fundamental components of the multi-agent framework, including:
* Agent
* LLM
* Tool
* Knowledge
* Memory
* Planner

All domain components within agentUniverse adhere to a unified design philosophy, exhibiting the following key characteristics:

* Configuration-oriented development enhances the efficiency of component creation and reuse.
* Each component has an independent manager, providing a unified and isolated mechanism for component registration, management, and integration.
* Standardized domain definitions support the seamless integration of similar components from across the industry.
* Components are highly customizable, allowing for tailored configurations to meet specific domain requirements.

This chapter will delve into the design principles of each domain component and provide guidance on how to effectively utilize them. Please refer to the sub-documents within this chapter for detailed information.
