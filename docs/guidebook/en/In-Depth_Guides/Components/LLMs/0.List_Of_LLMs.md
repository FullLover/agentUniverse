# List of LLMs
The platform has currently integrated the following list of models; please refer to this section for detailed usage instructions for each LLM.

| LLM (Series) Name         |
|---------------------------|
| [OpenAI](OpenAI_LLM_Use.md) |
| [Qwen](Qwen_LLM_Use.md)   |
| [WenXin](WenXin_LLM_Use.md) |
| [Kimi](Kimi_LLM_Use.md)   |
| [BaiChuan](BaiChuan_LLM_Use.md) |
| [Claude](Claude_LLM_Use.md) |
| [ollama](Ollama_LLM_Use.md) |
| [DeepSeek](DeepSeek_LLM_Use.md) |
| [GLM](GLM_LLM_Use.md)     |

To facilitate the integration of models with OpenAI-style protocols, we offer a wrapper object based on the OpenAI general protocol. See [OpenAIStyleLLM](OpenAIStyleLLM_Use.md).

For LLM not included in the list, you can customize the integration of any LLM according to the steps provided in the [LLM definition](../../Tutorials/LLM/LLM_component_define_and_usage.md).

At the same time, we are adding the integration methods for common LLMs such as Gemini, Llama, ZhipuAI, etc. If you have used these LLMs in your projects and have created your own instances, we welcome you to submit a PR to become a contributor to agentUniverse.
