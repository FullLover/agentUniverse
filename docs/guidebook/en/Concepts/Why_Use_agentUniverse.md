# Why Use agentUniverse
**Why Choose agentUniverse**
agentUniverse is a multi-agent framework specifically optimized for tackling complex tasks in real-world business scenarios. It offers not only all the essential components required to build a single agent but also orchestration components for facilitating collaboration between multiple agents (similar to Pattern Factory). Developers can customize these collaboration modes to ensure that agents fulfill their respective duties and solve specialized problems within their domains more effectively. Furthermore, agentUniverse provides a mechanism for injecting expert experience, making it easier for developers and enterprises to build intelligent applications infused with professional know-how.


**Architecture Diagram**
agentUniverse boasts a range of basic capabilities, including single-agent functionalities, orchestration components for multi-agent collaboration modes, and tools and mechanisms for knowledge injection. Through the framework's standardized interfaces, users can seamlessly integrate their own models, knowledge bases, and tools, enabling different agents to leverage these resources effectively.

With these capabilities, you can build your own intelligent applications tailored to your needs. Moreover, the framework further provides key capability components and application solutions specifically designed for large model applications. These components address common challenges in large model applications, such as RAG (Retrieve-and-Generate), tool invocation, and security rigor, helping developers overcome inevitable difficulties. The application solutions, on the other hand, offer end-to-end solutions for typical scenarios of large model applications, such as knowledge Q&A, intelligent search, and analysis and interpretation, thereby enhancing application development efficiency.


**Core Features**

Based on the above introduction, we can summarize the core features of agentUniverse as follows:

**Â· Rich multi-agent collaboration mode:** 
Provides effective collaboration modes such as PEER (Plan/Execute/Express/Review) and DOE (Data-fining/Opinion-inject/Express) in the industry, and supports users to customize new orchestration modes to allow multiple agents to cooperate organically.

**Â· Fully Customizable Cumponents:** 
All framework components, including LLMs (Large Language Models), knowledge bases, tools, and memory, provide customization options for users to enhance their agents according to their specific needs.
**Â· Easily integrate domain experience:** 
Provide domain prompt, knowledge construction and management capabilities, and support domain-level SOP orchestration and injection to align agents to the level of domain experts.
